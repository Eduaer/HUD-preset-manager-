The tool allows you to edit individual HUD elements and switch between your HUD and a selected
preset in game using the Shift + G keys.


Works on any HUD in 16:9 and 4:3 

the presets currently available are designed to reduce visual distraction in the game, but you can use the preset system for anything.

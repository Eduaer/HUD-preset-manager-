OK, this code is a heck, so you need to use the
same stupid names I put in while testing, since 
my first preset system didn't work

go to “custom presets”, find the next empty number,
put the default_preset folder

put your hudanimations in 
default_preset\aninmIN\scripts\ammo.txt

put your hudlayout in
default_preset\hudlayout_ad_in\scripts\hudlayout.res

put the resource ui in
default_preset\cinema_hud\resource\ui

now list the ui elements you are going to change in
default_preset\ui_substituir.txt

check how this works in any other preset such as
backup cinhud\default_preset

to add custom materials, just place them in the folder
file\materials
all materials are together, there is no need for them to be separated

title.txt
description.txt
img.png
is what is shown in the visual part of the code
img.png needs to be 500x300

if you are really going to make a preset here, send it to my email 
teupai022@gmail.com 
so i can add it, don't forget to add your nickname or any digital signature 
in the img or in the description

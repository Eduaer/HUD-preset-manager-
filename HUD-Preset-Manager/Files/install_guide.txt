Type this command into your tf2 console or autoexec.cfg file

bind F11 "hud_reloadscheme"

If you want the viewmodel to disappear along with the HUD, then write that instead.

bind "f11" "toggle r_drawviewmodel 1 0;hud_reloadscheme"

Click the install button and select your HUD folder

It's ready, just press shift + g and your HUD will change in-game.




Q&A:

Q: Do I need to interact with this software to get it working again after I close the program or restart the PC?
A: No.

Q: Can I change the keys used?
A: No, I have no idea how to make a modular system. If you really want to, you can edit and recompile the ahk source (cinhud_toggle.ahk)

Q: My ammunition texture is a missing texture. What should I do?
A: Just restart TF2 and it should work forever. Textures do not reload with hud_reloadscheme.

Q: I don't have a custom HUD. Will it still work?
A: No, just download a HUD. If you don't want to change anything in your game, download a HUD that preserves the originality of the game, such as AMPHUD, but there are several like this, and also several tutorials on how to install a custom HUD.

Q: can i get vac banned? Is that against the rules?
A:No, no

Q: Will this unbind my shift and g keys?
A: no 

info: 
if you want the entire HUD to disappear, including the crosshair, health bar, and ammo indicator, you can use the game command 
cl_drawhud 0
If you want to implement a toggle system, just use it like this:
bind t “toggle cl_drawhud 1 0”
